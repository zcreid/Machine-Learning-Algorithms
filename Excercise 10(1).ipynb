The integer will be stored in the `kth_max` variable.\n","\n","For example, with a list of 7 integers, if `k = 2`, then `kth_max` will be equal to the second-largest integer in the list. If `k = 6`, `kth_max` will equal the 6th largest integer.\n","\n","Finding kth largest integer in a list\n","\n","## Coding Challenge[#](#Coding-Challenge)\n","\n","Take some time to figure out the smartest way to solve this problem.
