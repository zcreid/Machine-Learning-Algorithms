You are given two integers, `x` and `y`, as arguments. You must convert them into strings. The string value of `x` must be repeated `10` times and the string value of `y` must be repeated `5` times.\n","\n","At the end, `y` will be concatenated to `x` and the resulting string must returned.\n","\n","### Sample Input [#](#Sample-Input)\n","\n","```python\n","x = 3y = 4\n","```\n","\n","### Sample Output [#](#Sample-Output)\n","\n","```python\n","'333333333344444'\n","```\n","\n","## Coding Challenge [#](#Coding-Challenge)\n","\n","Take some time to figure out the logic behind this problem before jumping to the implementation.
